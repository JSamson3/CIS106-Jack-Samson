## Assignment 1
I have taken this class because I am curious about the subject as well as the fact that I believe that it will provide me with a better understanding of the subject as well as being able to further along my career prospects in order to find a successful job and career in the future so as to be successful. Along with that I wish to become a back end developer as I find the hard programing to be much more interesting than the pain and difficulty of designing the front end user interface and making sure that the red is the exact shade of red the client wants.

## Assignment 2
I decided on using Python because I had heard that it is a simple and easy to use programing language and more importantly easy to read as well as the fact that I know other people who use it so I can get additional outside assistance with various projects, so I do not stall on my work and things go very smoothly. I have also decided on using Visual Studio Code because that is what I am mostly familiar with because of past classes where I also used Visual Studio Code for things such as HTML, CSS, and basic text.
