## Assignment 1
I have taken this class because I am curious about the subject as well as the fact that I believe that it will provide me with a better understanding of the subject as well as being able to further along my career prospects in order to find a successful job and career in the future so as to be successful. Along with that I wish to become a back end developer as I find the hard programing to be much more interesting than the pain and difficulty of designing the front end user interface and making sure that the red is the exact shade of red the client wants.
