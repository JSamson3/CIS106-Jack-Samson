## Assignment 1
I have taken this class because I am curious about the subject as well as the fact that I believe that it will provide me with a better understanding of the subject as well as being able to further along my career prospects in order to find a successful job and career in the future so as to be successful. Along with that I wish to become a back end developer as I find the hard programing to be much more interesting than the pain and difficulty of designing the front end user interface and making sure that the red is the exact shade of red the client wants.

## Assignment 2
I decided on using Python because I had heard that it is a simple and easy to use programing language and more importantly easy to read as well as the fact that I know other people who use it so I can get additional outside assistance with various projects, so I do not stall on my work and things go very smoothly. I have also decided on using Visual Studio Code because that is what I am mostly familiar with because of past classes where I also used Visual Studio Code for things such as HTML, CSS, and basic text.

## Assignment 3
Today during these activities I learned about variables and how to declare them as well as the various different ways that they can be used primarily from these activities I believe that I will be able to use them for relatively simple programs for something like a calculator to make figuring out equations easier allowing me to speed up the process of completing my homework or school work faster. This should be a important lesson as variables are the most basic of things that should be understood when it comes to programing and to make sure I understood what declaring variables looks like in code I used the program to show me what my code would look like in other programing languages such as Python.

## Assignment 4
During todayâ€™s assignment I was tasked with learning about formatting code and how that could be useful that can be such as using snake casing and to provide whitespace around our equations as using them will allow others to read our code easier and make collaborations more easily doable along with practicing more activities through Python in order to make better use of our coding skills by creating glorified calculators by creating programs that do the math for you with equations that quickly turn tedious for anyone to do by them selves over and over again it is really quite convenient
